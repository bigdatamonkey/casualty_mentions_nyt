[Opening Scene]

In the ever-evolving landscape of information, a pivotal question arises: Are we truly informed in the Western world, or is there a missinformation propaganda shaping our perceptions?

Today, we embark on an illuminating journey, exploring real-time revelations that dissect media bias, particularly our propaganda hero for today, The New York Times (NYT).

[Introduction]

A researcher from the University of California has analysed the anti-Palestinian media bias in The New York Times, and as expected the results, challenges us to consider the narratives we encounter daily.

The data was collected from NYT own journals and words, a prominent western media outlet, of the main articles published from October 7 to 22nd of October.

Now, as graphs shows, that New York Times has consistently highlighted Israeli deaths more prominently (about 2-3 times) than Palestinian deaths. On October 12 and 13th, Israeli deaths received heightened attention, even as Palestinian casualties surged in reality. For every 1 Israeli killed 1 Israeli was reported by NYT, while for every 4 Palestinian killed, 1 Palestinian was reported!  

But this is not a manipulation of numbers ONLY!, but the language used too! 

- The language used diverges significantly. The word “slaughter” appeared 53 times to describe Israeli deaths but was COMPLETELY ABSENT in describing Palestinian fatalities.
- Palestinians, often unnamed, were referred to as “mourner,” “resident,” or “assailant,” lacking the personalized acknowledgment given to deceased Israelis.

- A stark example of Palestinian dehumanizing language, in one article, a murdered Palestinian was simply reduced and dehumanized to be referred as “bloodied corpse” of a presumed "terrorist".

So, after this, take a moment to think! Are we truly informed, or is disinformation subtly shaping our perceptions? This analysis urges us to question, evaluate, and engage critically with the narratives presented. In the complex realm of information, let us remain vigilant, fostering transparency and seeking the truth.
