In the ever-evolving landscape of information, a pivotal question arises: Are we truly informed in the Western world, or is there a subtler undercurrent of disinformation shaping our perceptions?

Now, as graphs shows, that New York Times has consistently highlighted Israeli deaths more prominently than Palestinian deaths. On 10/12 and 10/13, Israeli deaths received heightened attention, even as Palestinian casualties surged.

But this is not a manipulation of numbers, but language used is a key.

- The language used diverges significantly. The word “slaughter” appeared 53 times to describe Israeli deaths but was absent in describing Palestinian fatalities.
- Palestinians, often unnamed, were referred to as “mourner,” “resident,” or “assailant,” lacking the personalized acknowledgment given to deceased Israelis.
- A stark example: A murdered Palestinian reduced to the “bloodied corpse” of a presumed "terrorist," counted as a mention despite the dehumanizing context.
