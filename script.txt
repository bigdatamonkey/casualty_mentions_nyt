[Opening Scene]

In the ever-evolving landscape of information, a pivotal question arises: Are we truly informed in the Western world, or is there missinformation propaganda shaping our perceptions?

Today, we embark on an illuminating journey, exploring real-time revelations that dissect media bias, with a particular focus on our propaganda hero for today, The New York Times (NYT).

[Introduction]

Hello, this is Suits-Man, and we are here to expose the mainstream media that is attempting to brainwash their audience!

A researcher from the University of California has analyzed the anti-Palestinian media bias in The New York Times, and, as expected, the results challenge us to consider the narratives we encounter daily

The data was collected from The New York Times' own journals and words, focusing on the main articles published from October 7th to October 22nd.

Now, as the results show, The New York Times has consistently highlighted Israeli deaths more prominently (about 2-3 times) than Palestinian deaths. For example, On October 12th and 13th, Israeli deaths received heightened attention, even as Palestinian casualties surged in reality. For every 1 Israeli killed, 1 Israeli was mentioned, while for every 4 Palestinians killed, only 1 Palestinian was reported!

But this is not just a manipulation of numbers; the propaganda editors decided to play with the language as well!! 

- The language used diverges significantly. The word “slaughter” appeared **53 times** to describe Israeli deaths but was COMPLETELY ABSENT in describing Palestinian fatalities.
- Palestinians, often unnamed, were referred to as “mourner,” “resident,” or “assailant,” lacking the personalized acknowledgment given to deceased Israelis.

- A stark example of dehumanizing language towards Palestinians; in one article, a murdered Palestinian was simply reduced and dehumanized, being referred to as a 'bloodied corpse' of a presumed 'terrorist'.
